# Sniffing-Out-Dog-Breeds-With-AI
This project uses an ensemble of neural networks (VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2) to identify dog breeds in images. The ensemble combines individual model predictions, adjusting for breed-wise test accuracy, and employs logistic regression/KNN for refined final predictions.
